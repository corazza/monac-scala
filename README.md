Mona compiler (in Scala)
========================

Mona is a functional programming language with a focus on speed, safety, and control. To that end Mona integrates high-level abstractions like algebraic data types, higher-order functions, and type classes, with low-level and systems programming features like ownership and move/borrow semantics.

This version of monac is being written in Scala (named monac-scala), with the intention of compiling the proper version, which will be written in Mona.
